1. Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.*/

function tellFortune (numberChildren, partnerName, geographicLocation, jobTitle) {
    var fortune = 'You will be a ' + jobTitle + ' in ' + geographicLocation + 
                  ' , and married to ' + partnerName + ' with ' + numberChildren + ' kids.'
    return fortune;
}

console.log (tellFortune(1, 'Marija', 'Kragujevac', 'ekonomista'));

/*2. You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.

Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.*/

function calculateDogAge (puppyAge, conversionRate) {
    var conversionRate = 7 || conversionRate;
    var dogYears = puppyAge * conversionRate;
    var output = 'Your doggie is ' + dogYears + ' years old in dog years!';
    return output;
}

console.log (calculateDogAge (3));

/*3. Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.*/

function calculateSupply (age, amountPerDay) {
    var maxAgeSerbia = 73;
    var supply = (maxAgeSerbia - age) * amountPerDay * 365;
    var output = 'You will need ' + supply + ' to last you until ripe old age of ' + maxAgeSerbia;
    return output;
}

console.log (calculateSupply(48, 0.28));

/*4. It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."*/

function celsiusToFahrenheit (celsius) {
    var fahrenheit = (celsius*9)/5 + 32;
    return fahrenheit;
}

console.log (celsiusToFahrenheit(33));

function fahrenheitToCelsius (fahrenheit) {
    var celsius = (fahrenheit - 32)*5/9;
    return celsius;
}

console.log (fahrenheitToCelsius(91.4));
